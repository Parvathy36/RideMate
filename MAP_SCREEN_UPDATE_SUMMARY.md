# Map Screen Update Summary

## Overview
I've updated the [map_screen.dart](file://d:\ridemate\lib\map_screen.dart) file to incorporate route selection functionality while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing RideMate app flow.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added RouteOption Class
- Created a `RouteOption` class to represent individual route options with all relevant details:
  - ID for identification
  - Name for display
  - Distance in kilometers
  - Duration in minutes
  - Points (decoded polyline coordinates)
  - Summary description

### 2. Enhanced State Management
- Added new state variables:
  - `_routeOptions`: List of all available route options
  - `_selectedRoute`: Currently selected route option

### 3. Updated Route Fetching
- Modified `_fetchGoogleMapsWithAlternatives` to:
  - Populate the `_routeOptions` list with all available routes
  - Sort routes by distance (shortest first)
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing `_route`, `_distanceKm`, and `_durationMin` variables

### 4. Added Route Selection UI
- Added a floating action button that appears when multiple routes are available
- Added a route selection button in the map controls
- Implemented `_showRouteSelectionBottomSheet` method that displays:
  - All available routes in a bottom sheet
  - Distance and duration for each route
  - Visual indication of the currently selected route
  - Ability to select a different route

### 5. Enhanced Route Selection Logic
- Added `_selectRoute` method that:
  - Updates the selected route
  - Updates the map display to highlight the selected route
  - Adjusts the camera to fit the selected route

### 6. UI Improvements
- Updated the app bar to display information for the selected route
- Maintained the existing color scheme (deep purple theme)
- Improved visual distinction between selected and alternative routes

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Multiple Route Support**: Users can now see and select between multiple route options
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear visualization of route options with distance and duration information
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains intact
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of which route is currently selected
5. **Responsive Design**: Route selection UI adapts to different screen sizes

## How It Works

1. When the map screen loads, it fetches multiple route options using the Google Directions API
2. All routes are displayed on the map with the selected route highlighted
3. Users can tap the "Select Route" button to view all available routes
4. In the route selection bottom sheet, users can see details for each route and select their preference
5. When a route is selected, the map updates to highlight the chosen route

## Files Modified

- [lib/map_screen.dart](file://d:\ridemate\lib\map_screen.dart): Main implementation

## Testing

The implementation has been analyzed with `flutter analyze` and contains no syntax errors.
