# Debugging Changes for Map Screen

## Overview
I've added extensive debugging to the map screen to identify why straight lines are being displayed instead of proper routes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging in Initialization
- Added detailed logging in the route initialization process
- Added logging to show when routes are being fetched from Google Maps
- Added logging to show the calculated distance between pickup and destination
- Added logging to show when fallback to direct line is happening

### 2. Enhanced Logging in Route Fetching
- Added detailed logging in `_fetchGoogleMapsWithAlternatives` function
- Added logging to show the API request URL
- Added logging to show the API response status and body
- Added logging to show the number of routes found
- Added logging to show the encoded polyline strings
- Added logging to show the number of points decoded from each polyline

### 3. Enhanced Logging in Polyline Decoding
- Added logging in `_decodePolyline` function
- Added logging to show the encoded string being decoded
- Added logging to show the number of points decoded

### 4. Enhanced Logging in Polyline Creation
- Added logging in `_createPolylinesWithAlternatives` function
- Added logging to show the number of routes and alternative routes
- Added logging to show the number of points in each route
- Added logging to show when fallback to simple line is used

### 5. Route Color Correction
- Changed route color from purple to green as per project specification

### 6. Distance Check Logging
- Added logging to show the calculated distance between pickup and destination
- This will help identify if the distance check is too strict

## How to Use
After running the app with these changes, check the console output for detailed logging information. This will help identify:
1. If the Google Maps API is being called
2. If the API is returning routes
3. If the polyline decoding is working correctly
4. If the polylines are being created correctly
5. If the distance check is causing fallback to direct line

## Files Modified
- [lib/map_screen.dart](file://d:\ridemate\lib\map_screen.dart): Main implementation with debugging

## Next Steps
1. Run the app and check the console output
2. Look for any error messages or unexpected behavior in the logs
3. Based on the logs, we can identify the root cause of the straight line issue
