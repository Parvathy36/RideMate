# Google Maps Route Selection Solution

## Problem Analysis

The original implementation was showing straight lines between locations instead of proper road-following routes. This happened because:

1. **Improper polyline decoding**: The encoded polyline strings from Google Directions API weren't being properly decoded into actual map coordinates.
2. **Missing alternatives parameter**: The API wasn't being requested for multiple route options.
3. **Inadequate route visualization**: All routes were displayed with the same styling, making it hard to distinguish the selected route.

## Solution Implementation

I've created a complete, standalone example that addresses all your requirements:

### 1. Multiple Route Display
- Uses `alternatives=true` parameter in Google Directions API to fetch multiple route options
- Sorts routes by distance (shortest first) for better user experience

### 2. Proper Polyline Decoding
- Implements robust `_decodePolyline` function that correctly converts encoded strings to LatLng coordinates
- This eliminates the straight line issue by drawing actual road-following paths

### 3. Route Selection Interface
- Provides a bottom sheet interface for users to select between different route options
- Clearly displays distance and duration for each route
- Highlights the selected route on the map with different styling

### 4. Visual Route Differentiation
- Selected route: Blue, thicker line
- Alternative routes: Grey, thinner lines
- Clear visual indication of which route is currently selected

### 5. User Experience Features
- Automatic camera fitting to show the entire selected route
- Markers for source and destination locations
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive UI with clear route information

## Key Technical Details

### Polyline Decoding
The core fix for the straight line issue is the proper implementation of the polyline decoding algorithm:

```dart
List<LatLng> _decodePolyline(String encoded) {
  // Algorithm that converts Google's encoded polyline format 
  // into actual latitude/longitude coordinates
}
```

### Multiple Routes API Call
The Google Directions API is called with the `alternatives=true` parameter:

```dart
final url = Uri.parse(
  'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json'
  '?origin=${origin.latitude},${origin.longitude}'
  '&destination=${destination.latitude},${destination.longitude}'
  '&key=$apiKey'
  '&alternatives=true' // Key parameter for multiple routes
  '&mode=driving'
  '&units=metric'
);
```

### Route Visualization
Routes are drawn with different styling to clearly indicate the selected route:

```dart
Polyline(
  polylineId: PolylineId('route_$i'),
  points: route.points,
  color: isSelected ? Colors.blue : Colors.grey.shade400,
  width: isSelected ? 6 : 4,
  geodesic: true,
)
```

## Files Created

1. `lib/route_selection_example.dart` - Main implementation
2. `lib/main_example.dart` - Example app entry point
3. `ROUTE_SELECTION_EXAMPLE.md` - Documentation
4. `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## How to Integrate

1. Add the required dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` (already present in your project)
2. Add your Google Maps API key to platform-specific configuration files
3. Use the `RouteSelectionExample` widget in your app

## Requirements Met

✅ Display all available travel routes between given source and destination  
✅ Show routes accurately along roads, not straight lines  
✅ Sort routes by distance (shortest to longest)  
✅ Display routes in a bottom sheet for user selection  
✅ Allow user to select a preferred route, which is then highlighted on the map  
✅ Show distance and duration for each route option  

This implementation provides a production-ready solution that can be easily customized for your specific needs.
